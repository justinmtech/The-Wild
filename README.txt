This is a simple command-prompt RPG game made completely in Java called The Wild.
It has an infinite leveling system, loot, skills, an inn and lots of weapons and armor to buy from the shop.
Feel free to leave some feedback or critique. This is my first 'big' OOP project, and I have been improving it over time as I find better ways to do things.
If you need help at any time in the game, just type 'help'.

I will update this to explain how to download and play the game without cloning it in your IDE soon.
